Notes from 10/26

----------
User Roles
----------

The system is now making the assumption that user role 1 is admin, 2 is regular user. All other values are invalid.

--------------
Updated Design
--------------

In the document, the logout() method took no parameters. We added the HttpSession to it as a parameter so that we can clear it in that method.

10/28 In the document, we did not include a function for getting all of the users, which we need for the view users page. We added one.

10/28 In the document, we did not include a function that retrieves a user by the user id, which we need for edit/delete. We added one to the controller and the session bean.
